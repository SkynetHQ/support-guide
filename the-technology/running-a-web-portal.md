# Running a Web Portal

## Web Portal Components

Skynet Web Portals consist of all the components needed to operate a publically accessible portal allowing access to the full Skynet ecosystem.

The web portal consists of:

1. a full Sia node
2. a full Handshake node
3. a web-server
4. a web-app frontend
5. various scripts for server maintenance

This list will continue to grow as we add functionality to support things like accounts and payment processing.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We're planning on making web portals easier to deploy and operate for technical users. We'd advise against deploying a public web portal yourself unless you have sufficient dev-ops experience and knowledge of local laws and regulations. Most users should access Skynet through a public portal like [Siasky.net](http://siasky.net).

{% hint style="info" %}
We've started making resources available in the Developer Documentation for [Running a Webportal](https://docs.siasky.net/webportal-management/). This is incomplete, but it can give you a sense of what running a web portal will look like very soon.
