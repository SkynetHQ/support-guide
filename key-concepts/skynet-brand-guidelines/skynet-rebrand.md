# Navigating the Skynet rebrand

![](../../.gitbook/assets/skynet-banner.png)

With the launch of Skynet, Nebulous' focus shifted from building the leading decentralized data storage platform to enabling a user-controlled, truly decentralized internet. As a result, our company has completely [rebranded into Skynet Labs](https://blog.sia.tech/introducing-skynet-labs-434c852cce07), with all our attention on developing Skynet and its ecosystem.

The Sia storage network is now under the custody of the [Sia Foundation](https://blog.sia.tech/launching-the-sia-foundation-ee47dfab4d2c), a nonprofit that will develop Sia from here on out.

Our team and the community also frequently used the terms Nebulous/Sia/Skynet to refer to the same products and/or people. As Skynet Labs emerges and the Sia Foundation takes shape, we're taking steps to more clearly differentiate the brands across our social platforms.

Here's the changes that you'll see.

## Skynet

| What's changing? | What was it? | What is it now? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Our company name | Nebulous | Skynet Labs |
| Twitter | @SiaTechHQ | [@SkynetLabs](https://twitter.com/skynetlabs) |
| Discord | /sia | [https://discord.gg/skynetlabs](https://discord.gg/skynetlabs) |
| Facebook | @Siacoin | [@SkynetLabsHQ](https://www.facebook.com/SkynetLabsHQ) |

Some things aren't so easy to split up, or still benefit both communities enough to keep them blended for now.

* We'll continue to share the [Siacoin Blockfolio Signal](https://blockfolio.com/coin/SC) account, the [r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/) subreddit, and the [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/siatvofficial) with the Sia Foundation.
