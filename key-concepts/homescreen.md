# Homescreen

## Introduction

Homescreen provides a way for users to save immutable versions of application front-ends by saving a version of the app to their [MySky files](https://docs.siasky.net/skynet-topics/mysky-and-dacs/mysky-files). This means each user owns their copy of the app and is in complete control of version updates. We see this as particularly necessary for the DeFi space for additional security and control over access to decentralized protocols and smart contracts.

Visit [https://homescreen.hns.siasky.net/](https://homescreen.hns.siasky.net/) to try out our initial release.

## Getting Started

First, authenticate with [MySky](mysky.md) â€”if you don't have an account, you can "sign up" and you'll be given an account recovery phrase.

Next, go to your favorite project's software repo \([example](https://github.com/SkynetLabs/uniswap-interface)\) and click the "Add to Homescreen" button.

Once logged in, you'll be presented with a prompt asking if you want to save the application to your Homescreen. If you press "Add to Homescreen," the app will be saved in your personal Skynet storage and the details added to your Homescreen.

Because we're saving the exact version, it acts like a snapshot. If you want the latest build, you'll want to "Update" your dapp.

Finally, you can manually add a skylink to an application or any other skyfile using the input field in the top right.
